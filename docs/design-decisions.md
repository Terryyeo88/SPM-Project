# Design decisions

Short entries for choices made on IS-1 (User Authorisation and Authentication)
that aren't obvious from the code alone. One paragraph each, written to defend
out loud, not as a changelog.

## Idle timeout: server-side tracking, not short-lived tokens

The acceptance criterion is "given a user session, when it's been idle beyond
a defined timeout, the user is logged out and must re-authenticate." Two
designs were on the table: (a) track last-activity server-side, keyed by the
access token's `session_id` claim, and reject once too much real time has
passed since the last authenticated request; or (b) lean on short
access-token lifetimes plus refresh-token rotation, with the frontend simply
stopping its refresh calls once it decides the user is idle. (b) was rejected
because the backend has no way to enforce it independently of the frontend —
"stop refreshing" is a client-side decision, and a modified or buggy client
could keep refreshing forever, silently defeating the control. For something
that's explicitly a security acceptance criterion, a control the client can
ignore isn't a control. (a) means the backend decides, on every request,
using its own record of real elapsed time — it can't be bypassed by anything
the frontend does or doesn't do. The frontend is still free to add its own
inactivity detection on top, as UX polish (faster, friendlier logout, less
wasted refresh traffic), but that's optional and doesn't change what actually
enforces the timeout.
