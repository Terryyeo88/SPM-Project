# Open questions

Things IS-1 decided and implemented, but that should still get explicit
customer confirmation rather than staying as our best reading of the
stories. Not implementation gaps — each of these has a decision already
made and recorded in `docs/design-decisions.md`; this file is the list of
decisions worth double-checking.

- **event.cancel's status range.** The Cancelled Status story says
  "after approval of the event request". We implemented that as the range
  `approved, planning, confirmed` (excluding `completed`), reasoning that
  the story's own scenario (coordinator can't secure a venue/equipment)
  happens during planning, not at the instant of approval — see
  `docs/design-decisions.md` §event.cancel. Please confirm "after approval"
  was meant as that range and not literally the single status `approved`.
